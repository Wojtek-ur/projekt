The "Graph Algorithms" project aims to develop an application for implementing and visualizing various graph algorithms. 
The primary focus is on the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. 
The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for creating, modifying, and visualizing graphs, as well as importing and exporting graph data.

Key Features:
Adding and removing vertices and edges
Implementing BFS and DFS algorithms
Importing and exporting graph data
Visualizing the graph and the traversal process
Interactive and scalable GUI for easy manipulation of graph elements
Implementation Details:
Developed using Java and IntelliJ IDEA
The Graph class manages the graph structure, including vertices and edges
The GraphAlgorithmsApp class handles the main GUI and user interactions
The GraphPanel class is responsible for drawing the graph and handling mouse interactions
Separate classes for BFS (BFSAlgorithm) and DFS (DFSAlgorithm) implement the respective algorithms

Project Outcomes:
The project successfully met its objectives by creating an intuitive application for working with graph algorithms. 
The implementation not only helps in visualizing how BFS and DFS algorithms work but also enhances understanding through interactive features. 
Future development plans include adding more graph algorithms and the ability to save results in a database.

How to run:
To start an software open GraphAlgorithmsApp.java and run main class from there.
